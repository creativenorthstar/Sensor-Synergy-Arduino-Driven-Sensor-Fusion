 An Small Replica of Chandrayaan-3 Pragyan Rover outfitted with Dallas temperature sensor, IR proximity sensor, Moisture sensor, Ultrasonic sensor, and BMP180â€”controlled by Arduino Uno. It reads the moon's mood, avoids obstacles, checks soil moisture, and senses lunar shimmies. 

Project Overview

This repository houses the research and development project dedicated to replicating the mechanics and sensor suite of India's Chandrayaan-3 mission, specifically focusing on the Pragyan rover launched in 2023. The project aims to emulate crucial functionalities of the lunar rover using a carefully selected suite of sensors, including the Dallas temperature sensor, IR proximity sensor, Moisture sensor, Ultrasonic sensor, BMP180, and a Vibrational sensor. The prototype, integrated with an Arduino Uno, not only mimics the rover's behavior but also serves as an educational tool for inspiring students in the field of space research and development.
